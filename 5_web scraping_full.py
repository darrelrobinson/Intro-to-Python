##Web scraper of imdb pages
##This gets the first 250 entries from the list of 2018 movies sorted by number of votes
##each page has 50 entries so the code loops over the first 5 pages of this list
##to increase/decrease the number of movies to return update the pages list

##start of the for loop
for p in pages:
    pg = url + p

    #this just forces the loop to wait 5 seconds before scraping the next page
    #it's always a good idea to add a sleep call when you scrape multiple pages,
    #you don't want to overload their server and crash the page
